# Lian Lian Kan

<p align="justify">This is an HTML 5 remake of Lian Lian Kan, a classic tile matching game with a twist. The goal is to clear the board as many times as possible before your time runs out. Each time the board gets cleared you will get bonus points as well as additional extend-time and remove-pair uses. The number of uses you receive increases with your selected difficulty level. To match tiles, you must make a clear and unbroken path between two matching tiles in one of four ways: a straight and direct path, two moves in an L shape, three moves in an S shape or three moves in a U shape. A live demo can be found <a href="http://llk.krutsko.net/">here</a>. Make sure to try it out on your mobile device as well!</p>
